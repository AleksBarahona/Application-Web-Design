## What's the use of Markdown
A lightweight markup language that is used to format plain text documents.  
Created by John Gruber in 2004.

### Tagging options Markdown offers
- Headers
 - To create a heder, we need to use between 1 to six # simbols before the header text.
- Lists
 - to create an unordered list we use '-','*' or '+' before one or more text lines.
 - to create an ordered list we put a 1 before each line with a number
- Links
 - to create a link we need to to write his text between '[]' and write the URL between '()'
 - example [Link to this same repo](https://github.com/AleksBarahona/Application-Web-Design)
- Code blocks
 - used to display code snippets or other types of formated text
 - to create code block we need to enclose our text in triple backticks 
 - example:
 '''
 System.out.println("Hello world");
 '''
